- 🖥️ **New Terminal**: open a terminal window to run a Linux command

## Starting new projects

When you create new projects, you must **create a new branch**. Create a branch per project based on the `main` branch.

1. At the bottom of the window, click on the **Source Control** button (between the Codespaces button and the refresh icon)
2. At the top of the screen, click on **Create new branch from…**, then click `origin/main`
3. Type a meaningful name for your branch. For example, `loops` or `task2`.
   - Don't include spaces, symbols (aside from dashes or underscores), or capital letters in the name

## Switch to another project

1. At the bottom of the window, click on the **Source Control** button.
2. Click on your previous project.
